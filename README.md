Rock Paper Scissors
# Project's Description
This is the 3rd project I did following the Foundation Path of The Odin Project
# What I've learned
- I did things very rigorously and in a structured and slow manner so it worked out pretty well and smooth. But I didn't rememeber the last time very well so.
